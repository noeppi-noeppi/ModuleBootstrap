# Module Bootstrap

ModuleBootstrap provides a system to load a modular java environment leveraging the Java Platform Module System (JPMS).
It provides features such as nested jar loading, classloader isolation, which allows to load multiple versions of the
same class into same module layer and runtime transformation of classes.

ModuleBootstrap is published at [https://maven.tuxtown.eu/release](https://maven.tuxtown.eu/release).
